Assignment from Coursera's Using Databases with Python\
For this assignment, I wrote a program to build a set of tables using the Many-to-Many approach to store enrollment and role data.
This application will read enrollment/role data in JSON format, parse the file, and then produce an SQLite database that 
contains a User, Course, and Member table, and populate the tables from the data file.
