    "-   Analyze a real world data-set with SQL and Python\n",
    "-   Understand a dataset of selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago\n",
    "-   Learn how to store data in an Db2 database on IBM Cloud instance\n",
    "-   Solve example problems to practice your SQL skills\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will teach the basics of exploratory data analysis using SQL and Python, such as learning how to connect to the Db2 warehouse database, accessing the database, performing queries with SQL, and analysis with Python (via a Juptyer notebook)."

    "## Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago\n",

    "This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of the dataset can be found on [the city of Chicago's website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork-20127838&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork-20127838&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ), but to summarize, the dataset has the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Community Area Number** (`ca`): Used to uniquely identify each row of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Community Area Name** (`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago \n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Percent Aged Under** 18 or Over 64:Percent of population under 18 or over 64 years of age (`percent_aged_under_18_or_over_64`): (ie. dependents)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we'll take a look at the variables in the socioeconomic indicators dataset and do some basic analysis with Python."
