# Using SQL & Databases

To learn about relational databases and how to query them, I completed the University of Michigan's Coursera Course on Using Databases with Python and IBM's Coursera Course on Databases and SQL for Data Science.

For these courses I used IBM's Db2 platform, Jupyter Notebooks and Python files, to learn how to load and query data, as well as how to access databases by connecting to a database instance in the Cloud.

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQL, IBM Db2
